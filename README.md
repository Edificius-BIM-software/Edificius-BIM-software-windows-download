## 🧠 Overview  

**Edificius** is a professional architectural platform that unifies BIM modeling, design development, and project presentation into a single, coherent workflow. It enables architects to define building geometry, manage data-rich elements, and maintain consistency across all stages of a project.

The environment is designed to support clear decision-making, offering direct visual feedback as designs evolve. Building components remain interconnected, helping ensure that changes are reflected accurately throughout the model and documentation.

Edificius supports structured collaboration while remaining flexible enough for creative architectural exploration.
